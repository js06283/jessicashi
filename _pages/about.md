I'm currently a <b>first-year Operations Management PhD Student at New York University Stern School of Business</b>. In Spring 2024, I graduated from Columbia University, majoring in Operations Research and minoring in Economics and Computer Science. I am currently working under Professor Divya Singhvi on problems related to <b>human-AI collaboration with LLMs</b>. 

<b>What do I do? 🤷🏻‍♀️</b>

I'm interested in service modeling, logistics, and data engineering, hoping to investigate new ways to power decision-making systems in hospitals and civic applications. My most recent research focused on the modeling patient dynamics with simulation and predictive analytics for sepsis treatment. I have worked under Professor Carri Chan and Professor Vineet Goyal from Columbia Business School and IEOR on proactive patient treatment for sepsis. I've also collaborated with Professor Venkat Venkatasubramanian from Columbia Chemical Engineering to study the dynamics of the Schelling game of segregation. 

I've previously worked in software engineering at the US Census Bureau, Microsoft Maps, and Asana, primarily in full-stack and frontend web development. I love to build and think about new ideas for how we can use technology to improve the way we live and make decisions. 

At Columbia, I was a part of [Kappa Phi Lambda](https://columbiakappas.wixsite.com/taukpl), the only Asian interest sorority on campus, and I've had the privilege to serve as the president this past year. We grew our presence on campus and wider comunity, bringing in many new members and achieving our promotion to chapter status. 

I'm dedicated to promoting equitable access to opportunities and resources for my peers. I served as the co-president of CU INFORMS, our student chapter of the Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences. I have worked to reestablish our student chapter's standing with the national organizaiton and the school. I've also served as the Co-President of the [Columbia Data Science Society](https://cdssatcu.com/), where I've worked to organize the Columbia Data Science Hackathon with over 200 participants and drove the development of the Women in Data Science mentorship program.
